These classes do not represent a single coherent program, rather this repository consists of various classes that explore aspects of the ACM graphics tools as preperation for creating the Breakout program. There is no real order to them, though in terms of complexity you might want to approach them in this order:

*HelloWorld.java
*GraphicsTest.java
*Stair.java
*MoveTurtle.java
*MovingBallAndPaddle
*DrawBricks

Each class can be run singly. MovingBallAndPaddle and DrawBricks are in their own folders because I named both classes Program.
